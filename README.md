<h2>My Stack 🥞</h2>
</div>
<p align="center">I am always looking to grow my skillset, but this is the current stack I work with.</p>

I am using Next.js/React predominantly for my full-stack applications. I love the developer experience of Next and Vercel, and I look forward to continuing to apply myself in learning about Next.js and its applications.

For frontend, I use CSS or tools such as Tailwind CSS, as well as HTML and React

For backend, I work with Node and Next.js API routes, and enjoy using serverless functions in the edge runtime.

For databases, I use MySQL and Postgres as query languages and work with tools like Supabase and MongoDB.

In terms of programming languages, Javascript, Typescript and Python are the three I am most familiar with.
